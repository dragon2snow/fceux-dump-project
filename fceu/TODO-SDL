TODO-SDL: 
* auto-resize game window (gtk)
* SDL 1.3?
	* segfaults when opening a second game
	* segfaults on fullscreen entry
* Hotkeys Config
	* design GUI
* Video config
	* grey-out xyscale entries when scalers are set
	* dont allow scalers and opengl 
* Implement Cheat Editor in GTK
* GUI Options to look into:
	* bpp
	* Scanline end/start
* Fix 7Zipped ROMs
* Think of good workaround for pushing F1 when run from a gui; currently drops to cheat menu with no terminal and is unrecoverable
