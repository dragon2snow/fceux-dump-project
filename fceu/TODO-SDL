**********  Update docs for ~/.fceux/cfg.d/ *******************************
-Features:
  - SDL.Vsync
    - let's wait on this -- there's no simple way to use the OS default in SDL unless we just don't touch it, which might be the best thing to do here.
-GTK:
  - Better on-the-fly video resizing with window resize / video config
  - Hotkey remapping GUI
  - Smarter video config (disable widgets that are incompatible with openGL)
  - Options to investigate 
    - bpp
    - scanlines
  - Cheat editor
-SDL 1.3
	- segfaults when opening a second game
	- segfaults on fullscreen entry
-BUGS
  - Zipped roms?
  - F1 from terminal-less gui fceux process hangs fceux (since input is required from console in cheat editor)
-OSX
  - Post official build instructions somewhere
  - Single window mode does not work (the XWINDOWID hack does not work in Apple's X11 server, so this may never get fixed).
  - Zapper input is taken from GTK window instead of X11 window (a workaround could be implemented to resolve with with some #ifdef APPLE etc)
-DOCS
  - Be sure to include details about new scons features for package maintainers so that the manpage, luascripts, and auxlib will be included in future packages
  - Docs REALLY need a cleanup/rewrite
