	* DONE! Redesign internal data structures of hotkeys 
	* design UI
* Video config
	* make nice error for shaders/openGL (currently "couldnt open rom file") and more descriptive error on console
	* grey-out xyscale entries when scalers are set
	* dont allow scalers and opengl 
* Implement Cheat Editor in GTK
* Game genie from GTK
