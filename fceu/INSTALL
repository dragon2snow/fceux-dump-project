To compile and install FCEUX for SDL, follow these steps:

  1.  Ensure that scons and SDL are installed on your system.
    On an ubuntu/debian system, run:
      sudo apt-get install scons libsdl1.2-dev libsdl1.2debian-all

  2.  Enable options you would like to enable/disable in SConstruct file.

  3.  Run "scons" to build fceux.

  4.  To install, run "scons install".  You can optionally define a prefix with "scons --prefix=/usr install"

Users of Microsoft Visual Studio can use the solution files within the vc directory.
These solution files will compile FCEUX and some included libraries for full functionality.

CMake has been depreciated in favor of scons.
